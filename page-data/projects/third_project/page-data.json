Based in Oakland, Zoo Labs is dedicated to helping musicians run their music like a business.</p>\n<p>By teaching entrepreneurship and strategy to singers, songwriters and performers they provide the tools for success and resources for expansion. We were brought in to lead a workshop side by side with Erin, breaking down what it means to build a successful brand and how they can create one for themselves. When we began working with Zoo Labs, they had just completed the process of a logo redesign, but had yet to extend the brand to presentation materials. Armed with a new logo guideline, we developed a presentation template for not only our Brand for Musicians workshop, but for other instructors to use as well.</p>\n<p>When we take on new clients we don't see them as another paycheck or project, but a partnership that means what is good for us is good for them too. At the end of the day good relationship is just as important as a good design, and great relationships make for great work.</p>"},"nextProject":null,"previousProject":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Vinyl Week","slug":"vinyl_week","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/featured-image-c59ba84ae15944beeb9817035f8ac148.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"third_project","next":"ishouldneverexist","previous":"vinyl_week","test":"testing"}},"staticQueryHashes":["372650424"]}
